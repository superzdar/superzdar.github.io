        <h2>What is WebDAV</h2>
        <p>WebDAV is a HTTP plugin, the interface used by internet browsers and webservers to interact with one another.
            The WebDAV interface also allows a web server to function as a fileserver, allowing shared web content
            authoring.
            WebDAV enhances the number of standard HTTP procedures and headers so that a file or directory can be
            generated, a file can be modified, copied, transferred or deleted. <a

        <h2>History of WebDAV</h2>
        <p>The World Wide Web and the WorldWideWeb web browser were developed by Tim Berners-Lee. It was different from
            the browsers of today because it was not only able to view web pages, it could also edit them. As the
            internet expanded, it became for most people a read-only interface.
            A group of individuals, notably Jim Whitehead, who was awarded a PhD from California University, Irvine,
            tried to solve this constraint. The protocol was first specified in RFC 2518 and did not include versioning
            as it was thought to be too much work to do both. The project was divided between two work groups and in
            2002, RFC 3253 defined the Delta-V protocol, an extension for WebDAV. WebDAV was fully revised in 2007 with
            RFC 4918. <a href="https://www.cloudwards.net/what-is-webdav/#two">read more...</a></p>
